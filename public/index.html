  <h1>About Our Project</h1>
  <p>
    This project is part of our group's e-commerce term assignment. 
    We are building a stock trading website where users can explore their
    investment options, buy and sell stocks, and view market data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website will include a storefront for stock products, 
    a secure login and registration system, and a responsive interface 
    for an easy user experience.

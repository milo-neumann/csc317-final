      h1 About GatorTrade
      p.about-intro
        | GatorTrade is a fictional stock trading platform designed to feel like a modern brokerage interface, while staying safely in the 
        | realm of simulated data and practice trades.

        h2 What You Can Do on GatorTrade
        ul
          li Browse a catalog of fictional companies with playful but realistic descriptions.
          li View detailed stock pages with historical price data and charts.
          li Add buy and sell orders to your cart before confirming a transaction.
          li Track your holdings on the portfolio dashboard and see how they change over time.
          li Explore how front-end, back-end, and database layers work together in a cohesive app.

        h2 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
        p
          | Although the companies and prices are fictional, the underlying architecture is similar 
          | to a real trading platform:
        ul
          li A database tracks users, positions, and cart items.
          li Server-side routes handle authentication and portfolio logic.
          li Views are rendered with Pug templates and styled with custom CSS.
          li Charts and visualizations help turn raw data into something easier to understand.

        h2 Design Process
        p
          | As a team of two students, we focused on building a polished user experience while 
          | practicing key web development concepts. Some highlights from our process:
        ul
          li Building clean, readable code that is easy to extend.
          li Designing a user interface that feels friendly and modern.
          li Handling common edge cases like empty portfolios and invalid inputs.
          li Practicing collaboration workflows with Git and GitHub.

        p.about-outro
          | GatorTrade isn’t a real trading platform and doesn’t use real money, but it reflects the 
          | kind of user experience we’d want in a production-grade app. Thanks for taking the time 
          | to explore our project!
